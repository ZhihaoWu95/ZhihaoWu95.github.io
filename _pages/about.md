I am a fifth-year Ph.D student at the USSLAB from Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Wenyuan Xu, Prof. Xiaoyu Ji, and Prof. Yushi Cheng. I received my B.S. degree and M.S. degree from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My research interests include AI security, face authentication security, and privacy protection.

🔥🔥🔥 **I am in the job market now!**

<h2>News</h2>	

🌟 “Multi-modal Spoofing Attacks on 3D Face Liveness Detection via a Single 2D Photo” has been accepted by **IEEE TDSC** (CCF-A), Congratulations!

🌟 **UniID** has been accepted by **NDSS 2024** (Big 4, CCF-A), Congratulations!

🌟 **DepthFake** has been accepted by **IEEE S&P 2023** (Big 4, CCF-A), Congratulations!

<h2>Researches</h2>	
🚀 **DepthFake** : The first work exploits vulnerabilities in the strcutured-light camera to attack 3D liveness detection using a single 2D photo. By projecting carft-designed infrared scatters embedded with depth information, we achieve a spoofing attack in commercial 3D face authentication systems.The demo can be found at [DEMO](https://sites.google.com/view/depthfake). 

🚀 **UniID** : The first work exploits vulnerabilities in the enrollment phase of face authentication systems. The UniID allows multiple adversaries to perform face spoofing attacks without any additional disguise by enabling an insider to register
a universal identity into the face authentication database by wearing an adversarial patch. The demo can be found at [DEMO](https://sites.google.com/view/spoofing-cfas/).

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the USSLAB from Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Wenyuan Xu, Prof. Xiaoyu Ji, and Prof. Yushi Cheng. I received my B.S. degree and M.S. degree from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My research interests include AI security, face authentication security, and privacy protection.

🔥🔥🔥**I am in the job market now!**
